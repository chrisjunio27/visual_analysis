I've created a comprehensive Python script for exploratory data analysis of Zara sales dataset using matplotlib. The code includes:
Visualizations:

Distribution histogram - Shows the spread of numerical data
Box plots - Identifies outliers in your data
Missing values bar chart - Highlights data quality issues
Correlation heatmap - Shows relationships between numerical variables
Categorical distribution - Top categories visualization
Trend line plot - Shows patterns over records
Scatter plot - Reveals relationships between two variables

Features:

Automatic detection of numerical and categorical columns
Basic statistics and data info printed to console
Key insights summary
Professional layout with multiple subplots
Handles missing values gracefully
